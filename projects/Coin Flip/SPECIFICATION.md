# Specification: Coin Flip

## Expected Functionality
This project implements Coin Flip.

This is a Python program used to simulate a coin toss, in which a user is asked to pick a side (heads or tails), and the program selects a result at random between the two options. If the user's choice matches the result, they win the coin toss.
1. When the program is initiated, you will be prompted to choose either "heads" or "tails".
2. The program will then determine the winning result by random chance, and display it.

## Input
- User inputs as required by the application
- Configuration parameters as needed

## Expected Output
- Results based on the application's functionality
- Status messages and feedback to the user

## Usage
