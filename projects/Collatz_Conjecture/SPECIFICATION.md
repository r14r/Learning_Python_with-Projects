# Specification: Collatz_Conjecture

## Expected Functionality
This project implements Collatz Conjecture.

This code snippet is a simple implementation of an iterator that generates the Collatz sequence for a given positive integer greater than 1. The Collatz sequence is a process where each number transforms based on the following rules:
- If the number is even, divide it by 2.
- If the number is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.

## Input
- User inputs as required by the application
- Configuration parameters as needed

## Expected Output
- Results based on the application's functionality
- Status messages and feedback to the user

## Usage
```bash
python app.py
```
