# Specification: Mineral Processing Technology-Image Analytics

## Expected Functionality
This project implements Mineral Processing Technology Image Analytics.

In the field of Mineral Processing Technology, size analysis of the various particles of an extracted sample is of importance in determining the quality of minerals, entropy values and in establishing the degree of liberation of the values from the gangue at various particle sizes.
In this problem statement, candidate is required to analyze the mineral particles in the input folder and calculate the following -
The smallest circle that just encapsulates the particle (the circle has to be generated on the image).

## Input

- Configuration parameters as needed

## Expected Output
- Results based on the application's functionality
- Status messages and feedback to the user

## Usage
```bash
python app.py
```
