# Specification: Drowsiness Detector

## Expected Functionality
This project implements Drowsiness Detector.

We already did an eye-blink detector python project earlier, using Facial landmarks.
Now we will extend this feature to determine for how long does the eye of a person is closed. If the eyes are closed for a certain time, and the pattern is recurring, we'll assume the driver is dozing off and the alarm will be played.
We'll use librarries like openCV, dlib

## Input
- User inputs as required by the application
- Configuration parameters as needed

## Expected Output
- Results based on the application's functionality
- Status messages and feedback to the user

## Usage
```bash
python app.py
```
