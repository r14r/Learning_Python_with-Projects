# Specification: Eye Blink Detection

## Expected Functionality
This project implements Eye Blink Detection.

Here we are going to build upon this knowledge and develop a computer vision application that is capable of detecting and counting blinks in video streams using facial landmarks and OpenCV.
To build our blink detector, we’ll be computing a metric called the eye aspect ratio (EAR), introduced by Soukupová and Čech in their 2016 paper
Unlike traditional image processing methods for computing blinks which typically involve some combination of:

## Input
- User inputs as required by the application
- Configuration parameters as needed

## Expected Output
- Results based on the application's functionality
- Status messages and feedback to the user

## Usage
```bash
python app.py
```
