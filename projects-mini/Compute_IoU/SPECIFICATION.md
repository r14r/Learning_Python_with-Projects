# Specification: Compute_IoU

## Expected Functionality
This project implements Compute Iou.

The project will help you calculate Intersection over Union (IoU).
Intersection over Union (IoU) is used when calculating mAP. It is a number from 0 to 1 that specifies the amount of overlap between the predicted and ground truth bounding box.
Use the Script [Compute_IoU.py](https://github.com/Python-World/python-mini-projects/blob/master/projects/Compute_IoU/Compute_IoU.py) . In the command line, Enter

## Input
- User inputs as required by the application
- Configuration parameters as needed

## Expected Output
- Results based on the application's functionality
- Status messages and feedback to the user

## Usage
```bash
python app.py
```
